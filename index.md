- AI-generated outputs (e.g., try-on results) are clearly labeled as "AI-generated" or similar indicators in the UI.
- Users are advised that results may not be 100% accurate and should be used for illustrative purposes only.

Users may not upload or generate content that is:
- Illegal or promotes illegal activity

- Graphic medical or shocking content
- Intellectual property violations (copyright, trademark) or infringing on othersâ€™ likeness without consent
- Personally identifiable information of others without permission

### 12.3 In-App Reporting and Flagging
- Every AI-generated output and user-uploaded content surface includes a "Report" action, allowing users to flag offensive or prohibited content.
- Report categories include (but are not limited to): sexual content, violence/hate, harassment/bullying, privacy violation, IP infringement, spam/scam, other.
- Within the report flow, users can add an optional note and contact email for follow-up.

### 12.4 Moderation and Enforcement
- Reported content is queued for review by our moderation team.
- Timeframes: urgent categories (e.g., child safety, explicit sexual content, credible threats) are prioritized; we aim to review high-severity reports within 24 hours, and all reports within 72 hours.
- Actions may include: content removal, temporary or permanent account suspension, feature restrictions, and reporting to authorities when legally required.
- We maintain audit logs of moderation decisions and preserve evidence as required by law.

### 12.5 User Controls
- Users can delete their own generated outputs and uploaded photos at any time.
- Users can block or mute other user accounts (if applicable features exist in your region/version).
- Users can limit who can interact with them (e.g., only contacts/friends) where supported.

### 12.6 Appeals Process
- If your content is removed or your account is restricted, you may appeal via the in-app appeal form or by emailing support at `tafakkur.dev@gmail.com`.
- Appeals are reviewed by a separate reviewer when possible. We will notify you of the outcome and reinstatement if the appeal is approved.

### 12.7 Data Handling for Reports
